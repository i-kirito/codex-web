Rebuild from a clean checkout of the pinned commit:

```text
cp vendor/gpt-image-playground/package-lock.json <upstream-checkout>/package-lock.json
git -C <upstream-checkout> apply <codex-web-checkout>/vendor/gpt-image-playground/patches/codex-web.patch
cd <upstream-checkout>
npm ci
VITE_API_PROXY_AVAILABLE=true npm run build
rsync -a --delete --exclude sw.js dist/ <codex-web-checkout>/vendor/gpt-image-playground/app/
```

The included `package-lock.json` is the upstream lock refreshed with
`npm audit fix` before building. It pins DOMPurify 3.4.12 and produced a clean
production dependency audit on 2026-07-25.

This embedded build adds a small same-origin bridge in upstream `src/App.tsx`.
It accepts prompt text, image parameters, and reference images from the Codex
Web prompt library, then fills the Playground gallery composer. The bridge
does not submit an image request automatically and does not accept messages
from other origins.

The patch also completes the gallery composer's `@` reference flow. Typing
`@` with no current reference images now offers an upload action; after a
successful upload, the reference picker reopens so the new image can be
inserted as an explicit mention.

When embedded in Codex Web, the build imports a paired image and Agent profile
from the authenticated `/api/playground-config` endpoint. Gallery requests and
Agent image tools use the Images API profile, while Agent conversations use the
Codex provider's Responses API profile. Server values initialize missing
profiles, while a URL or credential entered in the Playground settings remains
authoritative on later loads. The image profile also preserves a previously
chosen image model and initially uses `gpt-image-2`; the Agent profile follows
the current Codex text model. Codex CLI compatibility mode remains enabled only
on the image profile, so multi-image requests are split into concurrent
single-image calls instead of sending an unsupported `n` parameter to
Codex-compatible image gateways.

In hybrid Agent mode, an explicit image request now falls back to the paired
Images API profile when the initial text-planning request fails before any
tool output is produced. Text-only prompts keep their original error behavior,
and nested `response.failed.response.error` messages are surfaced instead of a
generic streaming failure. The embedded build also relies on the host browser's
native module-preload support, avoiding the iframe MutationObserver polyfill.

The Codex Web build enables the Playground API proxy. Proxied requests include
the normalized browser-configured API URL as `codex_upstream`; Codex Web only
forwards supported image and Responses API paths to configured Provider origins
or origins explicitly listed in `PLAYGROUND_PROXY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Browser
credentials remain authoritative and browser cookies are never sent upstream.

Codex Web serves this build at `/playground/` behind its existing Web login.
The upstream caching service worker is replaced with a non-caching shim that
unregisters itself, so an authenticated page is not kept available offline
after logout. API profiles, keys, history, and images remain in the
Playground's browser-local storage and are not copied into Codex Web's server
configuration.
